## Description
<!-- A clear and concise description of the new connector you want to add e.g. 
Propose adding a Salesforce source connector to enable data extraction from Salesforce CRM. -->

## Motivation and Context
<!-- Why is this addition important for the project? How would it benefit users? e.g.
Many of our users utilize Salesforce for customer management and would benefit from direct data integration. -->

## Proposed Implementation
<!-- If you have an idea of how to implement it, please share it here e.g 
Use restforce gem to connect and send data to Salesforce CRM. -->

## Alternatives Considered
<!-- Describe any alternative solutions or features you've considered e.g.
An alternative is to use direct API calls to Salesforce, but this lacks the robustness and community support of an established connector.-->

## Additional Context
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here e.g
Salesforce API has limits on the number of calls, which should be handled gracefully by the connector. -->

## Documentation
<!-- Outline any documentation that will be needed for this new connector e.g
Document OAuth setup, basic usage examples, and error handling strategies.-->
